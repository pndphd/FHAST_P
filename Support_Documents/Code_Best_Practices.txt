Data Tables
- Articles are designated with three fields (first author last name, year, journal)
- Journal abbreviations (https://www.library.caltech.edu/journal-title-abbreviations)
- all lower case headers and variables "velocity_mps"
- Top row should be headers with labels.	
	If labels aren't clear, include a ReadMe 
- Each row under that is a single record. 
- Each column is a single variable. 
- Every column should be consistent.
	All numbers should have the same number of decimal places. All dates should be formatted consistently. All Text fields should use controlled vocabulary. All coded values should be consistent. Etc. 
- Don't use color or comments to add meaning
- Don't leave cells empty 
- Put notes in a separate file

Model Development
Conduct basic analytical tests of modelling framework before implementing the ABM

R
End product should be functions	
Look at tidyverse linter https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html
Code should be highly commented. 
All lower case headers, functions, and variables "velocity_mps"
Functions start with verbs
Each significant action needs to be called out with a comment
The code should be foldable (see coding template) 
Use “modern R” (tidyverse and associated packages) whenever possible

NetLogo
Code should be highly commented. 
All lower case headers and variables "velocity_mps"
Each significant action needs to be called out with a commnet
Consider and address bottlenecks

File Structure
data (stuff that would be model inputs)
	GIS
	tabular
temporary 
	NetLogo
	R
outputs
	data
	figures
	report		
scripts
	NetLogo
		predation
		feeding
	R
		predation
		feeding
			R
			data_raw (for cal or fitting of feeding)
			data (just feeding parameters)

make package if we have several models using fame functions.
